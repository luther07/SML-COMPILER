Exercise 1a: Implement a member function that returns true if the item is found else false. Done, easy, but need to write some tests.
Exercise 1b: Extend the program to include not just membership, but the mapping of keys to bindings.
Exercise 1c: These trees are not balanced; demonstrate the behavior on the following two sequences of insertions:
             t s p i p f b s t:
                    
                     t
                    s
                   p
                  i
                 f
                b

             a b c d e f g h i:

                     a
                      b
                       c
                        d
                         e
                          f
                           g
                            h
                             i

Exercise 1d: TODO (more challenging)
