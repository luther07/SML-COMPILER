### Here I'm using ML-Lex to create a lexer for simple arithmetic.

#### I started with the outdated examples code in the ML-Lex manual.
#### I converted the code to ML97.

#### The interactive lexer "interactive.sml" is very useful, because
you can evaluate lexer() repeatedly and enter text into stdin, which
will cause the input tokens to be read until the input stream is empty.
