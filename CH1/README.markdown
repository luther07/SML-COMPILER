* Exercise 1a
  * Implement a member function that returns true if the item is found else false. Done, easy, but need to write some tests.
* Exercise 1b
  * Extend the program to include not just membership, but the mapping of keys to bindings.
* Exercise 1c
  * These trees are not balanced. Demonstrate the behavior on the following two sequences of insertions.
             t s p i p f b s t:
                    
                     t
                    s
                   p
                  i
                 f
                b

             a b c d e f g h i:

                     a
                      b
                       c
                        d
                         e
                          f
                           g
                            h
                             i

* Exercise 1d 
  * From Sedgewick[1997], which balanced BST data structure is best for a functional-style symbol table?
    *Randomized BST: has average-case performance which is an improvement on standard BST's, because standard BST's depend on receiving input for insertion with 
random ordering of their keys.
    * Splay BST:
    * Top-Down 2-3-4 BST:
    * Red-Black Trees:
    * Skip Lists:
