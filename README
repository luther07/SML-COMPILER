* I have the book, Modern Compiler Implementation in ML.

* I have installed sml/nj and associated tools.

* I am learning how to implement a compiler by implementing a compiler.

* 10/19/11
  I have implemented exercise 1 from page 11, a max args function that counts the maximum number
  of args to a PrintStm constructor in a nested statement. Cursory testing shows the function
  to be likely correct.

* 10/20/11
  I have finished with renaming the mutually recursive functions to maxargsStm and maxargsExp.
