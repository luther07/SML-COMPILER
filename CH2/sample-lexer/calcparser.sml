(* Sample interactive calculator to demonstrate use of lexer
   The original grammar was
       stmt_list -> stmt_list stmt
       stmt -> print exp ; | exp ;
       exp -> exp + t | exp - t | t
       t -> t * f | t/f | f
       f -> (exp) | id | num
  The function parse takes a stream and parses it for the calculator
  program.
  If a syntax error occurs, parse prints an error message and calls
  itself on the stream. On this system that has the effect of ignoring
  all input to the end of a line.
